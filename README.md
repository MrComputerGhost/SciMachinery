##Code Style
SciMachinery's standard for code style is described by an eclipse formatter (as well as cleanup rules) hosted [here][EclipseStuff].

Code styling is not enforced: I will reformat code that is not formatted IF I ever happen to be in the file that has that code. Basically, I always press `ctrl+shift+f` before saving and closing files, so... your formatting will likely be changed to mine.
