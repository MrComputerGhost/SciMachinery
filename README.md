<h2>Code Style</h2>
SciMachinery's standard for code style is described by an eclipse formatter (as well as cleanup rules) hosted here: <a href="https://github.com/sci4me/EclipseTools">github.com</a><br/>Code styling is not enforced: I will reformat code that is not formatted IF I ever happen to be in the file that has that code. Basically, I always press ctrl+shift+f before saving and closing files, so... your formatting will likely be changed to mine.<br/>
